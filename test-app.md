## Testing Steps

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Ensure Supabase environment variables are configured
2. Run database migrations using the schema in `_plans/schema.sql`
3. Seed sample questions using `/api/seed-questions` endpoint
4. Run additional functions using `_plans/additional-functions.sql`

### 2. User Authentication
1. Navigate to the application
2. Sign up or log in through the authentication flow
3. Verify redirection to the protected dashboard

### 3. Dashboard Testing
1. Verify dashboard displays correctly with no sessions initially
2. Check that statistics show zeros for new users
3. Test navigation links in the header

### 4. Session Creation
1. Click "New Session" or navigate to `/study/create`
2. Test each study mode:
   - Random: Should show total questions available
   - By Chapter: Should show chapter selection with question counts
   - Mixed: Should allow multiple chapter selection
   - Mock Exam: Should show timer and question count sliders
3. Create a session and verify navigation to question page

### 5. Question Page Functionality
1. Test answer selection (both clicking and keyboard shortcuts 1-4)
2. Test answer submission (Enter key or button)
3. Verify feedback display after submission
4. Test flag functionality (F key or button)
5. Test skip functionality (S key)
6. Test timer display (should count up for normal modes)
7. Test progression through multiple questions

### 6. Session Summary
1. Complete a session or navigate to `/study/[id]/summary`
2. Verify final score and accuracy calculation
3. Check chapter breakdown table
4. Test question review tab
5. Test action buttons (New Session, Review, Statistics)

### 7. Navigation & Persistence
1. Test navigation between pages
2. Verify session state persistence
3. Test browser refresh during active session

## Sample Database Queries for Verification

```sql
-- Check sessions created
SELECT * FROM study_sessions ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check user progress
SELECT 
  up.*,
  q.chapter,
  q.question
FROM user_progress up
JOIN questions q ON up.question_id = q.id
ORDER BY up.answered_at DESC;

-- Check question pools
SELECT 
  sqp.*,
  q.chapter
FROM session_question_pool sqp
JOIN questions q ON sqp.question_id = q.id
WHERE sqp.session_id = [SESSION_ID];

-- Get session statistics
SELECT * FROM get_session_statistics([SESSION_ID]);
```

## Known Limitations & Next Steps

### What's Working

### Areas for Future Enhancement
- ⏳ Review mode implementation (placeholder exists)
- ⏳ Advanced statistics and analytics (placeholder exists)
- ⏳ Settings and preferences (placeholder exists)
- ⏳ Question filtering and search
- ⏳ Export functionality
- ⏳ Mobile app optimizations

## Performance Notes
- Question loading is optimized with React Query caching
- Timer runs efficiently with Zustand state management
- Database queries use proper indexing
- UI components are optimized with shadcn/ui

## Security Features
- Authentication required for all protected routes
- API endpoints validate user sessions
- Progress data is tied to authenticated users
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
